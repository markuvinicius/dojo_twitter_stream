# Dojo Twitter Stream

This project contains an application for capture Twitter posts by Twitter Stream API and a small Java Reactive API for 
integration with AWS Comprehend.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. 
See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```
Docker Comunity Edition - 2.0.0.3 (https://docs.docker.com/install)
Docker Compose (https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)
Java 8 (https://www.java.com/pt_BR/download/)
Apache Maven 3.6.1 (https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi)
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

#### Building the Twitter Collector Docker Image

Once you have cloned the repository, proceed like that:

```
cd tweepy-collector;

docker build \                                                                                                                 
    --build-arg CONSUMER_TOKEN=<YOUR_TWITTER_CONSUMER_TOKEN> \
    --build-arg CONSUMER_SECRET=<YOUR_TWITTER_CONSUMER_SECRET> \
    --build-arg API_KEY=<YOUR_TWITTER_API_KEY> \
    --build-arg API_SECRET=<YOUR_TWITTER_API_SECRET> \
    -t tweepy-collector .
```
The arguments in the above command are:
* <YOUR_TWITTER_CONSUMER_TOKEN>: You should put your Twitter Consumer Key Here
* <YOUR_TWITTER_CONSUMER_SECRET>: You should put your Twitter Consumer Secret Here
* <YOUR_TWITTER_API_KEY>: You should put your Twitter API Key Here
* <YOUR_TWITTER_API_SECRET>: Your should put your Twitter API Secret Here

#### Running the Composer

The database and collector app are conteinerized at the docker-compose.yml file. To run those apps, you should execute:

```
docker-compose up -d
```

After that, you should have two containers running: A MongoDB document database and a Python Twitter Streamer. To check it out, run the command above:

```
docker-compose ps
```
#### Running the Reactive API (Under Revision)

In order to run the Java Reactive API:

```
cd TwitterRxApi
mvn spring-boot:run
```

After that, you should be able to request some data from the api like that

```
curl localhost:5000/tweets
```

With a twitter post in hands, now you can interact with the amazon comprehend capabilities. 
In order to extract entities from the text, you can call the api like that:


```
curl localhost:5000/tweets/{id}/comprehend-entities
```

With a twitter post in hands, now you can interact with the amazon comprehend capabilities. 
In order to extract sentiment from the text, you can call the api like that:


```
curl localhost:5000/tweets/{id}/comprehend-sentiment
```

With a twitter post in hands, now you can interact with the amazon comprehend capabilities. 
In order to extract key phrases from the text, you can call the api like that:


```
curl localhost:5000/tweets/{id}/comprehend-keyphrases
```
