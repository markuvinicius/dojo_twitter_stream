# Dojo Twitter Stream

This project contains an application for capture Twitter posts by Twitter Stream API and a small Java Reactive API for 
integration with AWS Comprehend.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. 
See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```
Docker Comunity Edition - 2.0.0.3 (https://docs.docker.com/install)
Docker Compose (https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)
Java 8 (https://www.java.com/pt_BR/download/)
Apache Maven 3.6.1 (https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi)
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

#### Building the Twitter Collector Docker Image

Once you have cloned the repository, proceed like that:

```
cd tweepy-collector;

docker build \                                                                                                                 
    --build-arg CONSUMER_TOKEN=<YOUR_TWITTER_CONSUMER_TOKEN> \
    --build-arg CONSUMER_SECRET=<YOUR_TWITTER_CONSUMER_SECRET> \
    --build-arg API_KEY=<YOUR_TWITTER_API_KEY> \
    --build-arg API_SECRET=<YOUR_TWITTER_API_SECRET> \
    --build-arg APPLICATION_ENVIRONMENT=<ENVIRONMENT> \
    --build-arg AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=<YOUR_AWS_KEY_ID> \
    --build-arg AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=<YOUR_AWS_ACCESS_KEY> \
    -t tweepy-collector-stream:0.1.1 .    
```
The arguments in the above command are:
* <YOUR_TWITTER_CONSUMER_TOKEN>: You should put your Twitter Consumer Key Here
* <YOUR_TWITTER_CONSUMER_SECRET>: You should put your Twitter Consumer Secret Here
* <YOUR_TWITTER_API_KEY>: You should put your Twitter API Key Here
* <YOUR_TWITTER_API_SECRET>: You should put your Twitter API Secret Here
* <ENVIRONMENT>: You should put your environment config here according to `/config/config.json` file \
* <YOUR_AWS_KEY_ID>: You should put hear a valid AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID with permission to put data into kinesis
* <YOUR_AWS_ACCESS_KEY>: Yout should put hear a valid AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY with permission to put data into kinesis

#### Building Twitter Reactive Comprehend API [DEPRECATED]

##### This project is Deprecated after introduction of AWS Kinesis architecture

In order to run the Twitter Reactive Comprehend API you need to build the container image. To accomplish this task, proceed like that:

```
cd TwitterRxApi;

mvn clean package -Pdev;

docker build \
--build-arg AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=<YOUR_AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID> \
--build-arg AWS_SECRET_KEY=<YOUT_AWS_SECRET_KEY> \
--build-arg JAR_FILE=target/<APPLICATION.JAR> \
-t datadealers/twitter-rx-comprehend \
.
``` 
The arguments in the above command are:
* <YOUR_AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID>: You should put your AWS ACCESS KEY Here. 
* <YOUT_AWS_SECRET_KEY>: You should put your AWS SECRET KEY here.
* <APPLICATION.JAR>: You should put yout application name corresponding to the version generated by the package command.

To change the application version, change the version number in [pom.xml] file
To find out how to generate an aws access key, check this link out: https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/create-access-key/

<b>Important</b> 
The access key passed to the application must have access to the AWS Comprehend service. To find out how it works, please check this link out: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/comprehend/latest/dg/access-control-overview.html


#### Running the Composer

The database and collector app are conteinerized at the docker-compose.yml file. To run those apps, you should execute:

```
docker-compose up -d
```

After that, you should have two containers running: A MongoDB document database and a Python Twitter Streamer. To check it out, run the command above:

```
docker-compose ps
```
#### Calling the Reactive API 

##### Get All the Tweets

```
curl localhost:5000/tweets
```

##### Get the Tweet Entities

With a twitter post in hands, now you can interact with the amazon comprehend capabilities. 
In order to extract entities from the text, you can call the api like that:


```
curl localhost:5000/tweets/{id}/comprehend-entities
```

##### Get the Tweet Sentiments

With a twitter post in hands, now you can interact with the amazon comprehend capabilities. 
In order to extract sentiment from the text, you can call the api like that:


```
curl localhost:5000/tweets/{id}/comprehend-sentiment
```

##### Get the Tweet Key Phrases

With a twitter post in hands, now you can interact with the amazon comprehend capabilities. 
In order to extract key phrases from the text, you can call the api like that:


```
curl localhost:5000/tweets/{id}/comprehend-keyphrases
```
